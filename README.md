# Finalproject
final project for INST326

team members: henry m., joseph h., mary w.

Functions were mostly developed by the team somewhat evenly, however we focused on specific ones

Henry McCormack mainly authored:
  main()
  battle() (full of block that really should be their own functions)
  check_select()
  ItemCatalog() (including methods)
  

Audio files were taken from Earthbound: Halloween romhack and pokemon red/blue
  This includes: meg_intro.mp3, meg_loop.mp3, and slash.wav
