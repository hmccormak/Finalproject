# Finalproject
final project for INST326

team members: henry m., joseph h., mary w.

Functions were mostly developed by the team somewhat evenly, however we focused on specific ones

Henry McCormack mainly authored:
  main(),
  battle() (full of block that really should be their own functions),
  check_select(),
  ItemCatalog() (including methods)
